The name SnowPuppyCoin is derived from the meme term for a husky puppy dog dog of a snowy and ium/eum place for a pertaining to in this case puppy dog dogs of a natural snowy enviornment. The name comes from the team’s extensive experience in the meme field with top level skills covering all aspects of it. This is a unique strength in the crypto community and will leverage well into a successful project.

Introduction
The SnowPuppyCoin mascot is a very cute Husky snow puppy dog dog named Mooner who was born from the fairly simple meme idea, introducing smart meme contracts which would allow on chain meme, trustless snow puppy cuddly snuggle transfers (goodbye centralized shady token marketplaces) on the Ravencoin codebase, however with the automation of assets and SPUPC (SnowPuppyCoin).
The SnowPuppyCoin project has quickly evolved, adding innovative cute Husky snow puppy cuddly snuggly features that not only further expand the asset layer, but also introduce mooning features that could help other meme coin Blockchain projects get to the moon and beyond. Ravencoin unfortunately suffered several serious breaches of its asset layer, so that codebase has been abandoned by us. We are currently working with and building on the superior SnowPuppyCoin source code expanding its cute snow puppy cuddling and snuggling capabilities significantly.

SnowPuppyCoin is now a superior code fork of Bitcoin, Dash and Raptoreum. SnowPuppyCoin inherits current and optionally future features such as chain locks, oracles etc. We are further expanding SnowPuppyCoin's cuddling snuggling meme capabilities by adding the following features:
A)	The deployment of a unique asset meme layer.
B)	The option to lock X amount of meme coins or meme assets into a special meme transaction. Meme coins are unlocked at a block number of choice or timestamp.
C)	Trustless on chain meme transfers of meme assets and native meme coins VIA Smart Meme Contracts.
D)	Integrating, developing and deploying a VM meme protocol that would allow for smart meme contracts in 4 major superior programming languages as opposed to the situation with the Ethereum project being limited to solidity.

These additional features open up the power and ease of use of SnowPuppyCoin’s cuddly snuggly meme features to a greater variety of meme industries under the Distributed Application umbrella. DAPP's are a critical part of driving widespread meme adoption as recently seen with DEFI and SnowPuppyCoin hopes to help provide further meme alternatives and meme possibilities for DAPP developers particularly in the meme field for opening up new programming languages specifically for DAPP and contract meme development.

It is one of our goals to not only innovate new state of the art meme ideas for SnowPuppyCoin but to contribute back to the general crypto meme community with open-source features that anybody can use to help their Blockchain meme projects succeed.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is done in separate branches.
[Tags](https://github.com/raptor3um/snowpuppycoin/tags) are created to indicate new official,
stable release versions of SnowPuppyCoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
